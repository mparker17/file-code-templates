My File and Code Templates.

Since I work with [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) a lot, and I want to conform to the [Drupal Documentation Standards](https://www.drupal.org/coding-standards/docs), I found myself writing a lot of boilerplate. I created a bunch of templates to help me.

When I started using [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), and realized it lets you define file templates using [Apache's Velocity Template Language (VTL)](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html#Velocity_Template_Language_VTL:_An_Introduction), I adapted my templates to use VTL.

I used to keep these code templates in my own preferences file; but I've realized they might be helpful to other people too. So here they are.
